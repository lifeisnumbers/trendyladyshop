Most website analytics tools show you WHAT your users are doing, but now with our UserFeedback plugin, you can finally see WHY they are doing it. Collecting real user feedback allows you to learn what features are missing from your site, find new relevant products and for your store, understand how memorable your brand is, create visitor requested content, and more. The sky's the limit with what you can ask.

Our goal at UserFeedback is to help you grow your business by understanding what your users are really thinking for any type of website, so that you can maximize each visitor's experience.

Launching a user feedback survey is extremely simple, with no coding needed. Simply install our plugin, select what type of feedback you want to collect from our prebuilt templates, and start collecting feedback!

The UserFeedback survey widget will show up on your website automatically, allowing you to gather insights immediately when and where you want insights.

You can create an unlimited number of feedback surveys, so that you can gather feedback for specific types of products, certain blog posts, or even target users who have already made a purchase.
